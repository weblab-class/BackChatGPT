# BackChatGPT Wiki

The BackChatGPT Wiki has been written to help you not only while playing the game, but also learn more about AI in the process. You can search the Wiki at any time using `Command + K` on MacOS or `CTRL + K` on Windows.

While playing BackChatGPT, most of your interactions should be with the terminal that is built into the game window. We hope this will put you in the mindset of a developer as you try and deduce what prompts generated the outputs you see. As you navigate through this Wiki, you will discover some more commands that you can use in the terminal and that will help you reverse-engineer the prompts.
