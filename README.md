# BackChatGPT

The goal of BackChatGPT is to deduce what prompt created a GPT Output. We've created various tools to make this easier, but you'll have to read through the Prompt Wiki to find them. This helps educate people a little more on how AI works and what some of its limitations are while also being a fun, challenging game.
